An Inkjet printer is a printer for computers. It uses special ink to print on the paper. Another type of printing techology is the Laser printer.

Usually, inkjet printers are used by people who print very little. The ink comes in special ink cartridges, which can be very expensive and uneconomical. Also, the ink in the cartridge may dry up. This means that a new cartridge is needed.
